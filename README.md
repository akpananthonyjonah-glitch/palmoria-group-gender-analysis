# Gender Inequalities and Compensation Analysis for Palmoria Group using Power BI:

# 📊 Project Overview
This project presents a Gender Equality and Compensation Analysis for Palmoria Group, a manufacturing company operating across three regions in Nigeria. The analysis was carried out using Power BI to uncover gender-related workforce issues, salary disparities, bonus allocation patterns, and minimum wage compliance risks.
The goal is to provide data-driven insights that support fair pay practices, regulatory compliance, and strategic HR decision-making.

# 🎯 Objectives of the Analysis
The key objectives of this project are to:
Examine gender distribution across the organization, regions, and departments.
Analyze employee performance ratings by gender.
Identify gender pay gaps in salary and compensation.
Evaluate compliance with the $90,000 minimum wage regulation.
Analyze salary distribution using $10,000 pay bands.
Calculate employee bonus payments and total payroll cost.
Provide actionable recommendations to management.

# 🗂️ Data Description
Two datasets were used in this analysis:
1️⃣ Employee Dataset
Contains employee-level information, including:
Gender
Department
Region
Salary
Performance Rating
2️⃣ Bonus Rules Dataset
Defines:
Performance ratings
Corresponding bonus percentages
Both datasets were integrated and modeled in Power BI.

# 🔧 Data Preparation & Transformation
The following data cleaning and transformation steps were applied:
Removed employees without salary (no longer with the company).
Removed records with NULL departments.
Assigned “Undisclosed” gender where gender was not provided.
Created salary bands in $10,000 intervals.
Modeled bonus rules and calculated total compensation.

# 📈 Key Insights:
# Gender Distribution:
Workforce is slightly male-dominated (~49% male, ~46% female, ~4% undisclosed).
Gender imbalance is more pronounced in technical and leadership departments.
Abuja shows the most balanced gender distribution.
# Performance Ratings:
Majority of employees fall under Average and Good ratings.
Male employees slightly dominate higher performance ratings.
Performance ratings influence bonus allocation and income inequality.

# Salary & Pay Gap
Clear gender pay gaps exist, especially in:
Engineering.
Product Management.
Legal.
A significant number of employees earn below the $90,000 minimum wage.

# Minimum Wage Compliance:
Approximately 31% of employees earn below the mandated $90,000.
Kaduna has the highest compliance risk due to workforce size in lower pay bands.

# Bonus & Compensation
Bonuses are directly tied to performance ratings.
Total bonus paid: $1.78B.
Total payroll (including bonuses): $58.17B.
Bonus distribution mirrors headcount and performance patterns, reinforcing inequality.
